# Monarch Money (Typed)

This is a wrapper for the unofficial [Monarch Money Python API](https://github.com/hammem/monarchmoney). It adds some level of Typing to "some" of the calls. I am specifically using it for Home Assistant - and rather than fork the lib - hopefully this can just wrap it



## Usage


Look at `example.py` for usage example - or just replace `MonarchMoney` with `TypedMonarchMoney` and look at the directions in the parent repo
